### Continued development

i believe i did pretty well simplifying the pseudo element for the certain cases i need. Even though it was not much it was was more first time working with pseudo css. i see the scope of using it now, especially for large scale projects. i will definitely continue improving on advanced css elements. 

A hard tackle was mostly dealing with styling the child elements inside the li. Trying to keep them precisely at a certain width with a certain pixel dimensions was difficult. I will have to work on that.

another advanced css topic i would like to add is media queries, i believe im getting the hang of it although i still to learn a lot more patterns to fully untie the nots when trying to make it responsive. Consistency, consistency, consistency!
